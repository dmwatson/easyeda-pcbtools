# easyeda-pcbtools
An extension for EasyEDA with helpful tools in PCB design.

Currently the only tool is the Track Width calculator, which can quickly calculate your needed track width based on amperage and layer type. If you have any tracks selected, it will also give you the option to apply those widths to the selected tracks automatically.

### TODO

Planned tools (in no particular order): 

1. Uniform hole sizer
2. Hole alignment tool
3. ????

Maybe some more in the future. Make a request through Issues. 

*Note:* Bear in mind that there are some limits in EasyEDA and its API that might make something impossible to do right now. That's not to say that future releases of EasyEDA will make those things possible though. Stay tuned.
